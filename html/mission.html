        <p>In creating a base on the moon, we will be <strong>unlocking a
            new world of exploration</strong> into space. Not only does it
            open up new scientific and economic avenues, but it also will
            help bring mankind together in a singular effort.</p>

        <p>A moonbase opens up <strong>multiple <em>important</em> economic avenues:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>space tourists</li>
            <li>mining industries</li>
            <li>refueling stations</li>
        </ul>

        <img src = "../img/astro.jpg" alt = "astronaut image" width = "100%">
        

        <p>More importantly, it will also open the door to unlocking future space exploration:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>assess the health impacts of living in space</li>
            <li>learn how to build and operate a base on another celestial body</li>
            <li>test site for new technologies and spacecraft</li>
            <li>another list item here!</li>
